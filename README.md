We need to install few npm modules for the project to work.

### mongodb
```
npm install mongodb
```
This module helps us to connect to mongo Database for maintaining our record.

### formidable

This module helps us to study the data collected from the HTML and allows us to study the incoming data coming with our request object. In other words, it is used to get data from the form in HTML.
